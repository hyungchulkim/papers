# Resources
During the process of writing *AI Engineering*, I went through many papers, case studies, blog posts, repos, tools, etc. The book itself has 1200+ reference links and I've been tracking [1000+ generative AI GitHub repos](https://huyenchip.com/llama-police). This document contains the resources I found the most helpful to understand different areas.

If there are resources that you've found helpful but not yet included, feel free to open a PR.

## ML Theory Fundamentals
While you don't need an ML background to start building with foundation models, a rough understanding of how AI works under the hood is useful to prevent misuse. Familiarity with ML theory will make you much more effective.

1. [Lecture notes] [Stanford CS 321N](https://cs231n.github.io/): a longtime favorite introductory course on neural networks.
    
    - [Videos] I'd recommend watching lectures 1 to 7 from the 2017 course [video recordings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vT1JzLTH4G4&list=PL3FW7Lu3i5JvHM8ljYj-zLfQRF3EO8sYv). They cover the fundamentals that haven't changed.
    - [Videos] Andrej Karpathy's [Neural Networks: Zero to Hero](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ) is more hands-on where he shows how to implement several models from scratch.
2. [Book] [Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective](https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book1.html) (Kevin P Murphy, 2012)
    
    Foundational, comprehensive, though a bit intense. This used to be many of my friends' go-to book when preparing for theory interviews for research positions.
3. [Aman's Math Primers](https://aman.ai/primers/math/)
    
    A good note that covers basic differential calculus and probability concepts.
4. I also made a list of resources for MLOps, which includes a section for [ML + engineering fundamentals](https://huyenchip.com/mlops/#ml_engineering_fundamentals).
5. I wrote a brief [1500-word note](https://github.com/chiphuyen/dmls-book/blob/main/basic-ml-review.md) on how an ML model learns and concepts like objective function and learning procedure.
6. *AI Engineering* also covers the important concepts immediately relevant to the discussion:
    
    - Transformer architecture (Chapter 2)
    - Embedding (Chapter 3)
    - Backpropagation and trainable parameters (Chapter 7)

## Chapter 1. Planning Applications with Foundation Models

1. [GPTs are GPTs: An Early Look at the Labor Market Impact Potential of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10130) (OpenAI, 2023) 
    
    OpenAI (2023) has excellent research on how exposed different occupations are to AI. They defined a task as exposed if AI and AI-powered software can reduce the time needed to complete this task by at least 50%. An occupation with 80% exposure means that 80% of this occupation tasks are considered exposed. According to the study, occupations with 100% or close to 100% exposure include interpreters and translators, tax preparers, web designers, and writers. Some of them are shown in Figure 1-5. Not unsurprisingly, occupations with no exposure to AI include cooks, stonemasons, and athletes. This study gives a good idea of what use cases AI is good for.
1. [Applied LLMs](https://applied-llms.org/) (Yan et al., 2024)
    
    Eugene Yan and co. shared their learnings from one year of deploying LLM applications. Many helpful tips!

    One of the best reports I've read on deploying LLM applications: what worked and what didn't. They discussed structured outputs, latency vs. throughput tradeoffs, the challenges of evaluation (they spent most of their time on creating annotation guidelines), and the last-mile challenge of building gen AI applications.
1. [Apple's human interface guideline](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/machine-learning) for designing ML applications
    
    Outlines how to think about the role of AI and human in your application, which influences the interface decisions.
1. [LocalLlama subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/): useful to check from time to time to see what people are up to.
1. [State of AI Report](https://www.stateof.ai/) (updated yearly): very comprehensive. It's useful to skim through to see what you've missed.

1. [Professional artists: how much has AI art affected your career? - 1 year later : r/ArtistLounge](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtistLounge/comments/1ap0cm3/professional_artists_how_much_has_ai_art_affected/) 
    
    Many people share their experience on how AI impacted their work. E.g.:

    *"From time to time, I am sitting in meetings where managers dream of replacing coders, writers and visual artists with AI. I hate those meetings and try to avoid them, but I still get involved from time to time. All my life, I loved coding & art. But nowadays, I often feel this weird sadness in my heart."*

### Public datasets

Here are a few resources where you can look for publicly available datasets. While you should take advantage of available data, you should never fully trust it. Data needs to be thoroughly inspected and validated.

Always check a dataset's license before using it. Try your best to understand where the data comes from. Even if a dataset has a license that allows commercial use, it's possible that part of it comes from a source that doesn't.

1. [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets) and [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?fileType=csv) each host hundreds of thousands of datasets.
2. Google has a wonderful and underrated [Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/).
3. Governments are often great providers of open data. [Data.gov](https://data.gov) hosts approximately hundreds of thousands of datasets, and [data.gov.in](https://data.gov.in) hosts tens of thousands. 
4. University of Michigan's [Institute for Social Research](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/pages/ICPSR/index.html) ICPSR has data from tens of thousands of social studies.
5. [UC Irvine's Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/datasets) and [OpenML](https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&sort=runs&status=active) are two older dataset repositories, each hosting several thousands of datasets.
6. The [Open Data Network](https://www.opendatanetwork.com/) lets you search among tens of thousands of datasets.
7. Cloud service providers often host a small collection of open datasets;, the most notable one is [AWS's Open Data](https://registry.opendata.aws/).
8. ML frameworks often have small pre-built datasets that you can load while using the framework, such as [TensorFlow datasets](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/overview#all_datasets).
9. Some evaluation harness tools host evaluation benchmark datasets that are sufficiently large for PEFT finetuning. For example, Eleuther AI's [lm-evaluation-harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness) hosts 400+ benchmark datasets, averaging 2,000+ examples per dataset.
10. The [Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/) is a great repository for graph datasets.
